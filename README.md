# Peploe's

The Next.js website for [Peploe's](https://peploes.com/), a family-run restaurant
on St Stephen's Green, Dublin. See the [product brief](docs/project/brief.md)
for brand, content and visitor requirements.

## Development

Use the Bun version declared in [`package.json`](package.json).

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
test -f .env.local || cp .env.example .env.local
bun run dev
```

Set the required values in `.env.local` before starting the application.
Use `http://localhost:3000` for local public URLs and a disposable PostgreSQL
database for `DATABASE_URL`. Optional integration values can remain empty.

The inherited example API requires the existing database migrations. Verify the
database target before running `bun run db:migrate`. Protected example mutations
remain disabled until a verified session is implemented.

## Verification

Run `bun run format`, then `bun run ci`. Database integration tests run separately
with `bun run test:integration` against a migrated disposable database.
The GitHub workflow provisions its own database for that check.
