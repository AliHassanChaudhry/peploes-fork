# Sentry

Sentry reporting and source-map uploads require `NODE_ENV=production`.
A DSN is required for reporting. There is no separate enable flag.
Deployment labels do not control reporting. Each hosting project's environment
values select its Sentry account. `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` labels the events; it does
not enable or disable them.

## Files

- `sentry.server.config.ts` configures the Node.js runtime.
- `sentry.edge.config.ts` configures the Edge runtime.
- `src/instrumentation-client.ts` configures the browser SDK.
- `src/instrumentation.ts` loads the runtime config and exports
  `captureRequestError`.
- `src/lib/error-handler.ts` adds server-side context and tags.
- `src/lib/sentry-scrub.ts` removes request bodies, headers, cookies, user data,
  and request URL queries/fragments before errors or transactions leave any
  runtime. It also scrubs HTTP and navigation breadcrumb URLs and span URLs,
  because these can carry a ResDiary guest token. Console breadcrumbs are
  discarded; browser DOM breadcrumbs are disabled to avoid collecting guest text.
- `src/lib/client-errors.ts` reports browser exceptions.
- `src/components/app/atoms/sentry-error-boundary.tsx` captures React rendering
  failures.

## Configuration

```dotenv
SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=
SENTRY_RELEASE=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=
SENTRY_ORG=
SENTRY_PROJECT=
```

Use separate staging and production projects. The approved staging project is
`truedevs-jw/peploes-staging`; configure its same DSN on the server and browser.
Keep the upload token private. Browser values are compiled at build time.

```dotenv
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=staging
SENTRY_ORG=truedevs-jw
SENTRY_PROJECT=peploes-staging
```

`next.config.ts` derives `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` from these server build settings. Do not set
those derived values manually. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_RELEASE` is also derived from
`SENTRY_RELEASE`, falling back to the Vercel commit SHA. The upload wrapper and
all SDKs share that release. Leave `SENTRY_RELEASE` unset for normal Git
deployments; fixed verification release names below are historical evidence.
Use an explicit identifier on a host without Git metadata. Ensure the runtime server uses matching settings.
`NODE_ENV` sampling remains unchanged. The deployment label does not affect payment mode or reporting.

The upload wrapper requires `NODE_ENV=production` and `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`,
`SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT`. A DSN enables ingestion, not source-map upload.

The CSP permits Sentry browser ingestion only when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is
configured.

Existing production traces sampling remains `0.15`. Profiles, Replay and logs
are not enabled. Error sampling uses the SDK default (all eligible errors).
The lockfile resolves `@sentry/nextjs` 10.76.2 with Next.js 16.4.2; SDK 11's
`dataCollection` options must not be copied into this version.

## What to capture

Capture unexpected exceptions at the outer boundary that owns the request or
render. Expected failures remain typed results as described in the
[error-handling guide](error-handling-guide.md); do not turn them into exception
noise.

Add operation, module, and stage tags that help group an event. Include record
IDs only when policy allows it. Sanitize request bodies, headers, cookies,
tokens, email addresses, and user-entered text before adding context.
The hooks remove the structured fields listed above; they cannot guarantee that
an arbitrary exception message, tag, or manually attached context is safe. Keep
those diagnostic values free of guest details and credentials. `sendDefaultPii`
is explicitly false, and Node local-variable collection is disabled.

The ResDiary provider is the outer boundary for exceptions thrown inside it:
its `run` turns each one into a typed result, so no caller ever sees the
exception. `run` therefore captures it once, with the provider and operation as
context. The booking services' wrapper captures only exceptions thrown in the
services themselves.

Avoid capturing the same error in a service, action, route, and global handler.
One event with useful context is easier to investigate than four copies.

## Source maps

The Next config enables the Sentry build wrapper when `NODE_ENV=production`
and all upload variables exist, regardless of hosting provider or ingestion
DSN configuration. It passes
organization, project and auth token explicitly and requests source-map deletion
after upload with the installed SDK's `sourcemaps.deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload`
option.

Verify successful upload and removal of public maps in the deployment
environment. A local build without credentials proves neither upload nor
production symbolication. Check lazy chunks and map references as well as map
files, then inspect a matching deployed event's readable stack frames. Keep the
runtime release and uploaded artifact association consistent; the Next.js SDK's
build wrapper supplies its release/debug-ID integration.

## Verification

- Run the scrubber tests, which inspect an SDK envelope through a recording
  transport and await flush without making a network request.
- Verify the `NODE_ENV` requirement for local production builds, previews and live
  deployments, including missing DSNs.
- With an authorized project, trigger a controlled local verification error
  through the application initialization, then confirm its issue in Sentry.
  Use a production build and a separate test project for verification.
- Verify browser capture separately; a Node transport test does not prove that
  browser initialization, CSP or client rendering capture works.
- Confirm release, environment, tags, and readable stack frames.
- Inspect the event for secrets and personal data.
- Confirm that an expected `Result` failure creates no Sentry exception.
- Do not inject a deliberate error into the live site. Delete test events only
  when that operation is explicitly requested.

### Staging implementation verification on 2026-11-02

A separate Next.js project, `truedevs-jw/peploes-staging`, was created in the
user-supplied organization. The existing `prs-td` project was left unchanged.
During that verification, the ignored `.env` contained matching server/browser
staging DSNs and a local-verification release label.

The real Node configuration sent a controlled synthetic exception, received as
[PEPLOES-STAGING-1](https://truedevs-jw.sentry.io/issues/7824269979/), with
`environment=staging` and `release=peploes-staging-local-2026-11-02`. This proves
local server ingestion and release association, not a deployed request hook.

The real browser SDK also reported an unhandled synthetic timer exception as
[PEPLOES-STAGING-2](https://truedevs-jw.sentry.io/issues/7824316858/), with the same
staging environment and release. Browser transport, preview indexing and URL
scrubbing also pass the intercepted staging test. These local receipts do not
verify the hosted candidate, owner alerts or a deployed request hook. A separately approved organization token, `peploes-staging-build`, was created
with `org:ci` and saved only in the ignored worktree environment. This permission
is organization-wide; build settings target only `peploes-staging`. The normal
checkout and hosting settings were not changed by local setup.

A credentialed preview build uploaded artifact bundles containing 416 and 60
files for release `peploes-staging-uncommitted-2026-11-02-227359b`. No `.map` files
remain in `.next/static`. A temporary external fault driver, using simulated
ResDiary, triggered an error inside the compiled booking provider without adding
a route or changing production source. Sentry resolved its frames to
`src/lib/resdiary-provider.ts` lines 303 and 483 in
[PEPLOES-STAGING-4](https://truedevs-jw.sentry.io/issues/7824400239/).
This establishes local upload and server symbolication, not hosted or browser
symbolication. Existing SDK 10 build warnings about the deprecated wrapper import,
`disableLogger` and the optional router-transition tracing hook remain; the build
and source-map upload succeeded. Review those before a future SDK 11 upgrade.

The existing [high-priority alert](https://truedevs-jw.sentry.io/monitors/alerts/6276568/)
now targets Salman directly and filters `environment=staging` in this project.
The controlled owner-alert exception was received as
[PEPLOES-STAGING-3](https://truedevs-jw.sentry.io/issues/7824396043/), and its email
arrived in the owner's browser Gmail inbox. The connected Gmail tool uses a
different account and was not used as receipt evidence. Hosted candidate and
browser source-map verification remained open at that point. No credential
values are included in source or evidence.

The later hosted preview `dpl_3CJfahiCdq8Ehwaq1vfaqWVYXGoC` reports to this same
staging project. Its controlled browser exception arrived as
[PEPLOES-STAGING-5](https://truedevs-jw.sentry.io/issues/7824419763/), with
`environment=staging`, release `peploes-staging-preview-2026-11-02-227359b` and
the preview's `/book-a-table` URL. The hosted build log confirms artifact upload.
This first browser exception originated in a temporary test driver. A later
browser-only fault during calendar rendering arrived as
[PEPLOES-STAGING-6](https://truedevs-jw.sentry.io/issues/7824430457/), with the
same hosted release. Sentry resolved application frames to `src/lib/dates.ts:125`
and `src/components/app/molecules/table-booking-date.tsx:43`. The fault was
limited to a disposable browser context; no repository source or hosted
configuration was changed. This establishes deployed application browser-frame
symbolication. Four hosted map requests returned 403, which does not establish
map removal. Hosted server exception capture remains a verification item under
#78. See the [hosted handoff](testing-guide.md#hosted-staging-handoff-on-2026-11-02)
for the exact candidate and configuration boundaries.

### Historical verification on 2026-10-27

The `javascript-nextjs` project `truedevs-rn/peploes` was created in Sentry's US
region under the existing `truedevs` team. Local ignored environment settings
contain its server/public DSNs and upload organization/project; no upload token
was configured during this initial run.

An isolated local Next.js server threw `Peploes Sentry setup verification
2026-10-27` through a temporary route and the real `onRequestError` hook. Sentry
confirmed one occurrence in [PEPLOES-1](https://truedevs-rn.sentry.io/issues/PEPLOES-1),
with release `peploes-sentry-setup-2026-10-27`. The isolated process temporarily
used the `production` environment tag; no deployed production error was created.
The server was stopped and the test route is absent from the repository.

The event showed a named compiled `GET` frame and readable Next.js dependency
frames. Original application source mapping and authenticated map upload were
not verified in this initial run. The Sentry rendering showed only
request method/URL and no credential values, but did expose geolocation metadata;
that rendering is not a raw-payload privacy audit.

Format, lint, types, all 781 tests and both application/Studio builds passed.
The initial gate failed its dependency audit; the follow-up CI repair upgraded
Zod to `4.6.7`, Undici to `7.30.1` and Studio's DOMPurify to `3.4.17`.
The complete `bun run ci` gate now passes, including both high-severity audits.
The production-gate mutation
check failed for local and preview delivery when the gate was removed, then the
restored gate passed. Edge settings were tested under Bun's Node resolution;
actual Edge execution and browser delivery were verified separately below.

### Historical local release verification on 2026-10-27

A disposable copy ran the application's production build and Sentry upload
wrapper using the locally configured organization token. Its reporting gate
was enabled only in that process; its events used `local-verification` and
release `peploes-local-verification-2026-10-27`. The repository retains its
production-only reporting policy. No production deployment was made.

- An actual Chromium click raised an unhandled browser error, stored as
  [PEPLOES-2](https://truedevs-rn.sentry.io/issues/PEPLOES-2). Sentry resolved
  the minified frame to the temporary `page.tsx` handler, line 3, with original
  source context. Browser ingestion passed the application's CSP.
- The Node route error arrived as
  [PEPLOES-4](https://truedevs-rn.sentry.io/issues/PEPLOES-4), with the original
  `route.ts` line 5 and source context. These new events establish that the
  upload token and matching browser/Node artifacts work for this local build.
- A route probe returned `NEXT_RUNTIME=edge`; its thrown error arrived through
  `onRequestError` as
  [PEPLOES-3](https://truedevs-rn.sentry.io/issues/PEPLOES-3). Its Edge frames
  remained compiled, so Edge source-map resolution is not established. Next.js
  warns that this Edge runtime is deprecated. This verifies Next's local Edge
  execution, not a hosted Edge deployment.
- After upload, `.next/static` contained no `.map` files or line-based
  `sourceMappingURL` references. No temporary verification route was added to
  the repository.
- The final `bun run format` and `bun run ci` passed: 781 tests, both builds and
  both high-severity dependency audits. Standards and spec review found no
  blocking code defects.

The token stays in ignored `.env`; it is not a public variable or a PR
artifact. Sentry's event rendering still showed geolocation metadata, so these
checks do not establish a complete stored-payload privacy audit. Authenticated
upload and symbolication must still be checked against the build that is
eventually deployed.

Before deployment, configure `SENTRY_DSN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`,
`SENTRY_ORG=truedevs-rn`, `SENTRY_PROJECT=peploes` and the private build-time
`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in the production deployment environment. Verify upload and
readable deployed frames as part of the normal release flow.
