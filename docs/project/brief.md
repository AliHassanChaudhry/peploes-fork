# Peploe's website brief

## Identity and audience

Peploe's is an independent, family-run restaurant at 16 St Stephen's Green,
Dublin. Founded by Barry Canny in 2002, it continues under the next generation
of the Canny family. Its basement dining room, food, wine, service and people
should give the website its character.

Keep the existing brand, logo and colours. The experience should feel warm,
confident, contemporary and quietly luxurious. Gina explicitly rejects
fine-dining positioning, corporate styling, excessive gold, marble effects and
script-font luxury cues. Preserve recognition for loyal guests while welcoming
more diners aged 35 to 55. Show everyday dinners and lunches alongside
celebrations, rather than making the restaurant feel reserved for occasions.

## Required visitor journeys

| Area | Requirement from the brief |
| --- | --- |
| Homepage and mobile | Make Book a Table the primary action and easy to reach throughout the site. Menus, location, opening hours and contact details must be easy to find on a phone. |
| Reservations | Use ResDiary. Unavailable online dates must not imply the restaurant is fully booked. Some dates and tables are managed by the team. Offer telephone and email help; direct groups of more than seven guests to the team. |
| Menus and CMS | Authorised staff must be able to edit dishes, prices, regular and seasonal menus without developer help. Prefer structured web menus, with optional PDF downloads. |
| What's On | Staff can create, edit, publish and remove seasonal/event landing pages for campaigns, including Christmas, rugby, lobster season, wine dinners and Sunday dining. These examples are not confirmation of current events. |
| Our Story | Cover the founding, Barry Canny, the family and the next generation. The artist behind the name may appear but should not dominate. |
| Groups and celebrations | Provide relevant content, imagery and a dedicated enquiry journey. |
| Corporate events and exclusive hire | Give this audience its own information and enquiry journey. |
| Weddings | Present intimate city weddings through atmosphere, exclusivity, food and wine, with an easy enquiry route. Avoid generic package-led presentation. |
| A Letter from Gina | Offer a personal email subscription and connect it to existing customer/email systems where appropriate. |
| Search discovery | Create useful pages for real dining and event intents, with natural copy. |
| Analytics | Measure acquisition, page and menu interest, booking clicks, contact clicks, enquiries, subscriptions and event engagement. Track booking outcomes only where the integration supports them. Configure reporting for launch. |

Suppliers and provenance are an opportunity to develop over time. Gina suggests
showing real relationships, such as Higgins Family Butcher, through a possible
People & Produce section or stories within other pages. A standalone section is
not yet a launch commitment.

## Creative direction

Build around approved photography of the restaurant in service, food arriving
and being prepared, wine and cocktails, staff and family. Empty-room images and
isolated dishes alone will not communicate the intended experience.

Explore the descent from St Stephen's Green into the restaurant through image
sequence, colour and storytelling. Gina presents this as a possible direction,
not a requirement for an animation. Keep movement restrained and navigation
usable. Obtain the original logo, colour values and image files before settling
visual tokens or selecting final crops.

## Homepage content width

The Final Pages homepage (`3131:11098`) specifies desktop side padding, not a
shared content maximum. At the desktop breakpoint, `site-container` in
`src/app/globals.css` leaves 72px on each side; `site-container-inset` leaves
80px for the closing booking banner and footer. Their content widths are
therefore 1296px and 1280px only when the available page width is 1440px.
Both containers grow with wider pages and retain 24px gutters below the
desktop breakpoint. This fluid extension follows the frame's padding and
Fill constraints; Figma supplies a 1440px desktop reference, not additional
wide-screen frames.

Backgrounds and full-width photographs fill the page. Wine keeps its 748px
text column. Hospitality caps its text at 783px and reserves a separate artwork
column on desktop, with a 32px gap and the shared left gutter. Stories follows the
source frame's fixed 636px columns and 28px gap, shrinking those tracks on
narrower desktops without stretching them on wider pages. At 1440px its
desktop grid extends 4px beyond the 1296px content width. Its
right-hand cards similarly extend 4px below the 640px left card; preserve this
source geometry when comparing the design.

The navigation and features use inset rules so strokes do not change their
76px and 214px desktop heights or shift centered controls. Compare against
the browser's available page width, excluding the scrollbar gutter, at the
same zoom and pixel density. Check mobile, tablet, laptop and wide desktop
layouts for horizontal overflow and undistorted images after width changes.

## Mobile homepage reference

The 390px Final Pages mobile homepage (`3395:17700`) owns the phone layout.
Below 640px, use its 24px gutters, type sizes, vertical spacing, image frames
and stacked full-width actions. Keep the existing tablet and desktop layouts.
At the reference width the page is 11,526px tall, including the 72px header.
Sections may grow when narrower screens or enlarged text need more room.

Use the mobile entrance and dining-room photographs exported from Figma.
The reception artwork reproduces the mobile frame's image scaling. Photographs,
including the entrance, retain their aspect ratio and crop to their frames.
Event and occasion copy variants live beside their desktop content in the local
catalogs.
Mobile Stories uses the From the Cellar heading and omits the art description.
The closing booking heading is upright on mobile and retains its desktop italic.

Compare section positions, line breaks, crops and overlays at 390px, then check
narrow phones, tablet and desktop for overflow. Keep the existing inactive
actions, disabled newsletter and active telephone and email links.

## Homepage interaction previews

Placeholder actions use inert `type="button"` controls with `aria-disabled="true"`
and no click handlers. They remain focusable and show the Figma hover styles
without navigating, booking or submitting. Keep the newsletter input natively
disabled so it cannot collect an email address.

The existing shared button owns the homepage's brand variants: primary,
primary inverse, secondary inverse, editorial text, navigation and contact.
Use the Figma primary hover colour `#68181E`, 90% cream for inverse buttons,
burgundy fill for inverse outlines, underlines for text links, and a 6%
burgundy fill with a 60% border for contact actions. Navigation text changes
to burgundy with an underline. Interactions use the 160ms token and respect
reduced motion; buttons and images do not scale on hover.

Homepage action arrows use Lucide's 16px `ArrowRight`, matching the footer
Subscribe button, including the menu category arrows. Keep existing button
padding when adding direct SVG children; the shared Button's icon defaults
otherwise change it. Mobile navigation chevrons remain separate glyphs.

Verify hover and keyboard focus, unchanged layout, inactive placeholder clicks,
and working contact destinations when changing these controls.

## Navigation implementation

The initial navbar follows the Final Pages desktop navigation in Figma
(`3131:11099`), including the yellow note requiring a sticky header. It uses the
existing brand colours, DM Sans, 44px control targets and a centered logo.
The logo artwork comes from the [existing website](https://peploes.com/), stored
locally and tinted with the Ink token using a CSS mask. Preserve its aspect
ratio; replace it with the exact Figma vector when that export is available.

The desktop Menus dropdown follows Nav / Shelf / Menus / Light (`3041:2013`).
It opens on mouse hover or button activation and overlays the page below the
76px header without moving the logo or page content. The Warm Cream panel has
an editorial introduction and six destinations in three columns. Reuse the
homepage menu category order; destination actions remain inactive placeholders.
Verify pointer travel into the panel, keyboard activation and tab order, Escape
with focus restoration, outside-click and focus-leave dismissal, short-viewport
scrolling, reduced motion and dismissal when switching to mobile navigation.
The desktop Groups & Occasions dropdown follows Nav / Shelf / Groups / Light
(`3041:1933`): a 320px introduction, 56px column gap and three photo destinations
with 132px images. The local shelf catalog owns its copy and the crops exported
from Figma. Destination titles turn burgundy with a 32px underline on hover;
retain visible keyboard focus and the shared reduced-motion-aware duration.
Destinations remain inactive until their pages are built.

Both desktop shelves share one open state so switching triggers replaces the
visible panel. Verify switching by pointer and keyboard as well as dismissal.
The navbar renders shelf content and fonts on the server and passes the result
to the interactive navigation. Check font compilation in the dev server as well
as the production build.

Below the desktop breakpoint, navigation follows the Design System's light
mobile variants: closed (`3041:1863`), menu open (`3041:1812`) and Menus expanded
(`3041:1718`). The header is 72px tall with 24px gutters, the logo and a compact
Book button. The full-screen menu expands Menus and Groups & Occasions inline,
then shows Gift Vouchers, opening hours, address, telephone, email and the
People make Peploe's brand line. Preserve the 44px minimum control targets.

Page links, booking and Gift Vouchers remain inactive placeholders until their
journeys are built. Home, telephone and email links work. Keep modal focus
containment and restoration, Escape and close-button dismissal, scroll locking
and automatic dismissal at the desktop breakpoint. Verify both accordion
groups, narrow screens, short viewports, enlarged text and overflow with the
menu open and closed.

## Footer implementation

The shared footer uses Figma Footer / Production desktop (`3041:2359`) and the
mobile homepage footer (`3395:17877`). Desktop has brand, Explore, Contact and
newsletter columns. Mobile shows brand, newsletter, expanded Explore,
Occasions and Peploe's navigation, then contact details, socials and legal links.
It uses the existing local logo and brand tokens, DM Sans body text and
EB Garamond headings.
Footer dividers, mobile row borders and the email field rule use 1px thickness.
The three burgundy heading underlines are 32px wide and 2px high, matching Figma.

Telephone and email links are active. Navigation, legal and social destinations
remain inactive until approved destinations exist. The newsletter field stays
disabled and Subscribe remains inactive pending the subscription integration.
No email is collected or submitted. Opening hours and contact details follow
the design and should be confirmed by the restaurant before launch.

When changing the footer, verify the desktop columns, mobile reading order,
phone and email targets, keyboard focus, 200% zoom and horizontal overflow.

## Hero implementation

The homepage hero follows the Final Pages hero and entrance group (`3131:11100`).
The desktop photo panel is 780px tall with EB Garamond headings and DM Sans
supporting copy. Booking and telephone buttons remain placeholders.
On phones, the panel is 660px tall with 48px headings and stacked full-width
buttons. The 520px entrance photograph has a separate 74px caption below it.

The restaurant photo and transparent entrance artwork were downloaded from
Figma. The entrance uses its original Figma backdrop behind the cutout. Narrow
screens use the mobile design's vertical hero gradient over the centre crop.
The desktop entrance retains the yellow note's gentle fade and rise through
the existing scroll-reveal component and reduced-motion styles.

When changing the hero, compare desktop line breaks, photo crop, overlays and
the entrance overlap with Figma. Check image loading, narrow screens, sidebar
overlap, scroll reveal and reduced-motion styling.

The desktop hero, menu and wine backgrounds advertise the viewport width in
their responsive image sizes. Event cards and booking artwork follow their
responsive image boxes. The hero background retains larger mobile and tablet
sources for its tall crop. The Gina and Sunday source photographs are only
243px wide; larger originals are needed for sharper rendering on high-density
screens.

## Restaurant features implementation

The four features directly below the entrance follow the Final Pages section
`3131:11112`. They use the original 48px SVG illustrations exported from Figma,
22px EB Garamond headings and 14px DM Sans descriptions on Warm Cream. The
desktop row has 48px vertical spacing and a Soft Stone top border. It becomes
two columns on tablet and one column with 13px descriptions on phones.

When changing this section, compare its copy, icon order and desktop spacing
with Figma. Check that every illustration loads and that text wraps without
horizontal scrolling at narrow widths and enlarged text sizes.

## Menus introduction implementation

The homepage menus introduction follows Final Pages `3131:11245`. It uses the
dining-room photograph exported with Figma's crop, a 370px desktop image band,
the Our Menus eyebrow, and six categories in their design order. The content
uses the shared brand fonts, colours and content container. The category grid
adapts to three and then two columns on tablet, and six full-width ruled rows
on phones. Mobile uses its separate 238px-high dining-room photograph.

The yellow note (`3131:11686`) specifies structured web menu categories and
CMS-editable content. This section keeps the category actions and Explore Our
Menus button inactive, following the approved placeholder behaviour. Menu pages
and CMS integration remain future work. No PDF destinations are introduced.

When changing this section, compare the photograph's crop, heading, category
spacing and button with Figma. Verify image loading, placeholder controls and
text wrapping without horizontal overflow on narrow screens.

## What's On implementation

The homepage section follows Final Pages `3131:11285`: a dark burgundy
background, one featured event and a column of smaller cards. It uses the
original Figma photographs, EB Garamond headings and DM Sans supporting copy.
The cards stack on narrow screens.

The adjacent yellow note (`3131:11688`) calls for CMS-managed campaigns that
can be published or removed without changing the homepage layout, with cards
linking to their campaign pages. For this phase, the contributor requested
local event data and inactive links. Edit the ordered `whatsOnEvents` array in
`src/lib/constants/whats-on.ts` to add, remove or reorder cards; the first entry is
featured. An empty list hides the section. The Figma entries are preview copy,
not verified current events. CMS publishing and campaign destinations remain
future work.

When changing this section, compare its image crops, typography and desktop
spacing with Figma. Check image loading, stacked cards, long text and horizontal
overflow at narrow widths. Keep placeholder actions inactive until their
destinations exist, and verify zero, one and multiple event layouts when the
content source changes.

## Wine introduction implementation

The section immediately after What's On follows Final Pages `3131:11325`:
the wine-service photograph, a dark horizontal gradient, the Wine at Peploe's
eyebrow and the heading "Bottles worth lingering over." It reuses the same
photograph as the wine-dinner card, shared fonts and existing button component.
Its text column is capped at 748px with 80px desktop vertical padding. Phones
use the mobile vertical gradient, 720px minimum height and stacked buttons;
Stories from the cellar uses an outline on mobile.

The yellow Wine journey note (`3131:11692`) sends Explore the Wine List to a
structured wine menu and Stories from the cellar to related Journal content
when available. Both actions remain inactive placeholders until those
destinations are built, following the current homepage convention.

When changing this section, compare the background crop, gradient, line breaks
and stacked actions with Figma. Check image loading, mobile text contrast,
horizontal overflow and the two inactive controls.

## Groups and occasions implementation

The homepage section follows Final Pages `3131:11372`: a dining-room photo
banner with a dark horizontal gradient, followed by three cards on Warm Cream.
It uses the original Figma photographs, shared fonts and existing buttons. At
1440px, the banner is 410px tall and the cards have 180px-wide images. The cards
stack on smaller screens. Phones use a 560px banner with a vertical gradient
and horizontal cards with 124px-wide photos, reduced further below 360px.

The yellow Distinct commercial journeys note (`3131:11700`) requires separate
pages and enquiry experiences for Groups & Celebrations, Corporate & Exclusive
Hire and Weddings. These remain distinct cards with local content. The banner
button and three Explore actions stay inactive until their destinations exist,
following the approved homepage placeholder behaviour. Dedicated pages and
enquiry forms remain future work.

When changing this section, compare the photograph crops, gradient, typography,
card order and spacing with Figma. Verify image loading, four inactive actions,
mobile reading order and wrapping without horizontal overflow.

## Stories implementation

The homepage Stories section follows Final Pages `3131:11334`, with the original
Figma photographs, a large Our Story card, a People & Produce card and two smaller
Journal cards. It uses the shared brand fonts, colours and content container,
with the design's individual image gradients. The cards stack on narrow
screens, with a vertical gradient behind the producer copy on mobile.

The yellow Editorial gateway note (`3131:11698`) sends Our Story to its dedicated
page, the other cards to Journal categories or articles, and Explore the Journal
to the Journal hub. These actions remain inactive placeholders until those
destinations are built, following the approved homepage behaviour.

When changing this section, compare the card arrangement, image crops, line
breaks and overlays with Figma. Check all four images, mobile text contrast,
placeholder controls and horizontal overflow at narrow widths.

## Human Hospitality implementation

The homepage section follows Final Pages `3131:11401`, with the burgundy heading
"Would you prefer to speak to us?", a faded Warm Cream background and the
original transparent reception artwork from Figma. Its text column is capped
at 783px with 80px vertical padding. From 1280px, the reception crop occupies a
separate column capped at 563px, with a 32px gap so the copy cannot overlap it.
The section grows with the text. The image crop keeps the lamp, telephone and
reception sign in their design positions. Smaller screens stack the copy above
the artwork and let the contact buttons wrap.

The yellow Booking fallback note (`3131:11706`) requires functional phone and
email actions on desktop and mobile. These use `tel:` and `mailto:` links, with
the same shared contact details as the footer. They reuse the existing button
component and contact icons, with 44px targets and visible keyboard focus.

When changing this section, compare the heading sizes, image crop and spacing
with Figma. Verify image loading, contact destinations, keyboard focus, enlarged
text and horizontal overflow on narrow screens.

## Closing booking banner implementation

The banner immediately before the footer follows Final Pages `3131:11412`.
It uses the dark burgundy background, original botanical illustration at 35%
desktop opacity, 48px EB Garamond heading and 16px DM Sans supporting copy.
The phrase "from the city." uses the font's regular italic style. At 1440px,
the banner is 318px tall with 72px vertical padding.
On narrow screens the text wraps, margins reduce and the illustration fades
to keep the copy readable.

Book a Table remains an inactive placeholder, consistent with the existing
booking controls. The nearby Booking fallback note (`3131:11704`) requires
working phone and email options when online availability is missing. The
footer retains those active links; ResDiary integration remains future work.

When changing the banner, compare the italic text, botanical crop, background,
spacing and button with Figma. Check artwork and font loading, narrow-screen
wrapping, horizontal overflow and the inactive booking action.
